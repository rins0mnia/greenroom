# GREENROOM

**Greenroom** is a modular Creator OS for streamers, VTubers, and digital-native teams‚Äîblending content management, AI task orchestration, and brand infrastructure into one intelligent platform. It functions as a hybrid between a **CRM, campaign planner, and Chief of Staff**, purpose-built for the creator economy.

## ‚ú® Vision

Modern creators run digital businesses‚Äîbut lack the infrastructure to operate like one.

Greenroom gives creators and orgs a **centralized system** to manage:
- Campaign pipelines
- Brand assets
- AI-powered workflows
- Cross-platform analytics
- and intelligent support via **Kira**, your built-in Chief of Staff agent.

## üß† Agent Architecture

Kira is not just an LLM wrapper‚Äîshe is Greenroom‚Äôs central command system.

Every user request (from scheduling to content generation) flows through Kira, who:
- Holds context over time
- Routes tasks to sub-agents (e.g., Aura for content, Clove for learning)
- Executes tools, APIs, and prompts as needed
- Responds with high-context, structured outputs

Built with **LangChain**, Kira uses a modular toolset and router-based logic to power workflows, automate suggestions, and assist creator teams in real-time.
